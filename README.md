# DevSync
DevSync is a powerful tool designed for developers to effortlessly compare and synchronize coding projects. Whether you're working across multiple environments, collaborating with a team, or simply managing different versions of your codebase, DevSync helps ensure consistency by identifying and fixing discrepancies.

With DevSync, you can:

- **Compare Folders:** Analyze two coding project folders to identify missing files or differences in file content.
- **Fix Discrepancies:** Automatically resolve issues by restoring missing files and synchronizing content across projects.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Get comprehensive reports on the differences found and the actions taken to fix them.
- **Simple and Efficient:** Streamline your development process, reduce errors, and ensure that your projects are always in sync.

## Functionality

DevSync will:

1. **Traverse Folders and Sub-Folders:** Go through all the folders and sub-folders to ensure comprehensive comparison.
2. **Read Files:** Examine the content of each file to identify discrepancies.
3. **Generate Output:** Provide a detailed report indicating which folders, files, sub-folders, or file contents are missing.

**Decision Point:**

After generating the report, you can decide whether to:

- **Add Missing Elements:** Incorporate the missing folders, files, or content into your project.
- **Skip Additions:** Choose not to add the missing elements based on your specific needs.

The decision to update your folder with the missing elements is entirely up to you.

Whether you're managing a large codebase or just ensuring that your projects are sync, DevSync is the tool you need to keep your code organized and consistent.
